> iReporter enables any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the general public.

## Project Overview  
Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries must develop novel and
localised solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of iReporter. iReporter enables
any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the
general public. Users can also report on things that needs government intervention

## Required Features
1. Users can create an account and log in.  
2. Users can create a red-flag record (An incident linked to corruption).  
3. Users can create intervention record (a call for a government agency to intervene e.g
repair bad road sections, collapsed bridges, flooding e.t.c). 
4. Users can edit their red-flag or intervention records.
5. Users can delete their red-flag or intervention records.
6. Users can add geolocation (Lat Long Coordinates) to their red-flag or intervention
records
7. Users can change the geolocation (Lat Long Coordinates) attached to their red-flag or
intervention records.
8. Admin can change the status of a record to either under investigation, rejected (in the
event of a false claim) or resolved (in the event that the claim has been investigated and
resolved).

## Optional Features
1. Users can add images to their red-flag or intervention records, to support their claims  
2. Users can add videos to their red-flag or intervention records, to support their claims.
3. The application should display a Google Map with Marker showing the red-flag or
intervention location
4. The user gets real-time email notification when Admin changes the status of their record.
